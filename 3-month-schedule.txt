June, July, August

this is intended to be a living document,
fully subject to change and refinement.

05/27
deliverable : finished tests + numpy-formatted docstrings on graphutils.NdmgDirectory
deliverable : 3-month schedule
details : 
    - set up to build class from mock data directory with pytest
    - test to make sure order of NdmgDirectory.files matches order of .graphs, .X, .Y,
    - test on _pass_to_ranks  # TODO : specify how to test this. Talk to pedigo / j1
    - test on file saving method
        - output csv files to dummy folder
        - make sure I can recreate both X and Y, in proper order, from output csv files
    - 3-month schedule : should be "complete", e.g., all weeks are filled out with concrete deliverables.
      Should be updated / refined over time.

reasoning / comments :
    - I want a tool I know works, that I can build on, which will prevent me from spending a week concatenating graphs
    - gives me more experience working with pytest, so that I can plan better - specifically, I need to know how to run tests on sample data, and cache results for the next test
    - this will eventually get merged into `ndmg` or be converted into a QSIPrep utility package or put into graspy, but for now it's most useful as a standalone package

06/3 : OHBM hackashop
deliverable : ndmg docker image verified working, push standalone release
details : 
    - make sure atlases are pulled properly from neuroparc
    - talk to Derek about any other potential issues
reasoning / comments : 
    - OHBM hackashop seems like a good time to make absolutely sure we have a working docker image for AWS batch later

06/10 : OHBM
deliverable : notes summary of OHBM
details : 
    - notebook during the conference to keep track of stuff potentially useful for us
    - Summarize in document at the end
reasoning / comments : 
    - Open to other suggestions here


06/17 : OHBM / vacation
deliverable, last 3 days : aws grant
deliverable : Pictures of the summit of Mt. Pilatus :)
details : 
    - we are climbing a mountain
    - it will be beautiful
    - I am also working 2 days this week, during which I will write the AWS grant
reasoning / comments : 
    - the view at the top will be awesome
    - amount of work gives just enough time to squeeze in grant

06/24
deliverable : github test autorun on ndmg PR
details : 
    - Downsampled test data, 2 subjects, 2 sessions, from HNU1
    - Test for a nonzero amount of edgelist outputs
    - Make sure there are a nonzero amount of (node, node, weight) 3-tuples in each edgelist
    - potentially use https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cache/
reasoning / comments : 
    - Currently, every time we make a PR, we have to manually test to make sure the PR didn't break the pipeline. A simple check like this would dramatically speed up workflow in the future
    - This is up for debate, depending on whether QSIPrep already does this and whether it would be useful
    - I also want to get familiar with Travis, and this is a good way to do so

07/01
deliverable : AWS batch run on 1 subject
details : 
    - Run docker image from OHBM (or new one) locally first
    - Set up ndmg-data s3 bucket with proper permissions, put that image on to AWS-batch
reasoning / comments : 
    - once this is set up seamlessly, running on any dataset should be trivial

07/08
deliverable : 5 datasets, fully run on AWS batch
details : 
reasoning / comments : 

07/15
deliverable : jupyter notebook analysis of 5 datasets
details : 
- TODO : make this section more concrete
- use `graphutils` and `graspy` for this
- update `graphutils` as necessary, potentially make PR to graspy
reasoning / comments : 

07/22
deliverable : all datasets fully run on AWS batch
details : 
reasoning / comments : 

07/29
deliverable : website updated with all datasets
details : 
reasoning / comments : 

08/05
deliverable : jupyter notebook analysis of all datasets
details : 
reasoning / comments : 
- need to talk to jovo about what would be good here

08/12
deliverable : schedule for ndmg day of hackashop
details : 
reasoning / comments : 

08/19 : NeuroData Hackashop
deliverable : 
details : 
reasoning / comments : 

08/26
deliverable : more analysis?
details : 
reasoning / comments : 



Vague brainstorming
--------
-  Be writing code more often than I spent the first portion of my time here writing code
- derek / me tests
- make working with outputs easier
- data needs to get run so other people can use
- goal : get us to the point where the focus is on doing data science / data analysis, 
         not on fixing random bugs
- is it possible to get Drishti involved somehow?
- Ben gonna try to run ndmg


GENERAL THINGS : to be specified into deliverables
-------------
- OHBM gonna be a thing, figure out what I want to get out of it
- test on inputs / outputs
    - pytest fixture to create data directory
    - paramaterized fixtures to test different inputs
- derek wants test to make sure hemispheres are correct
    - create a hole in base image
    - right hemisphere or left hemisphere - image_R, image_L
    - run through ndmg
    - goal : test whether or not we get tractography with correct orientation
    - Streamlines should have hole on the same end
    - figure out how to make a hole in an image and save it on each side of the brain
- test of ndmg_dwi_worker
- AWS grant
- AWS batch : 5 datasets
- QA : ^5 datasets
- AWS batch : 20 datasets
- website updated
- my code for working with ndmg outputs
