June, July, August

this is intended to be a living document,
fully subject to change and refinement.


05/27
DELIVERABLE : finished tests + numpy-formatted docstrings on graphutils.NdmgDirectory
DELIVERABLE : 3-month schedule
details : 
    - set up to build class from mock data directory with pytest
    - test to make sure order of NdmgDirectory.files matches order of .graphs, .X, .Y,
    - test on _pass_to_ranks  # TODO : specify how to test this. Talk to pedigo / j1
    - test on file saving method
        - output csv files to dummy folder
        - make sure I can recreate both X and Y, in proper order, from output csv files
    - 3-month schedule : should be "complete", e.g., all weeks are filled out with concrete DELIVERABLEs.

reasoning / comments :
    - I want a tool I know works, that I can build on, which will prevent me from spending a week concatenating graphs
    - gives me more experience working with pytest, so that I can plan better - specifically, I need to know how to run tests on sample data, and cache results for the next test
    - this will eventually get merged into `ndmg` or be converted into a QSIPrep utility package or put into graspy, but for now it's most useful as a standalone package
    
06/3 : OHBM hackashop
DELIVERABLE : derek's test
DELIVERABLE : ndmg docker image verified working, push standalone release
details : 
    - make sure atlases are pulled properly from neuroparc
    derek test:
        - goal : test whether or not we get tractography with correct orientation
        - create a hole in base image
        - right hemisphere or left hemisphere - image_R, image_L
        - run through ndmg
        - Streamlines should have hole on the same end
reasoning / comments : 
    - OHBM hackashop seems like a good time to make absolutely sure we have a working docker image for AWS batch later
    - OHBM hackashop also seems like a good time to write the test derek wanted

06/10 : OHBM
DELIVERABLE : notes summary of OHBM
details : 
    - notebook during the conference to keep track of stuff potentially useful for us
    - Summarize in document at the end
reasoning / comments : 
    - Open to other suggestions here

06/17 : OHBM / vacation
DELIVERABLE, last 3 days : aws grant
DELIVERABLE, last 3 days : ndmg issues page cleaned up
DELIVERABLE : Pictures of the summit of Mt. Pilatus :)
details : 
    - we are climbing a mountain
    - it will be beautiful
    - I am also working 2 days this week, during which I will write the AWS grant and clean up the ndmg issues page, because it would be useful to start using it.
reasoning / comments : 
    - amount of time gives just enough time to squeeze in grant

06/24
DELIVERABLE : github test run on ndmg PR
details : 
    - Downsampled test data, 2 subjects, 2 sessions, from HNU1
    - Test for a nonzero amount of edgelist outputs
    - Make sure there are a nonzero amount of (node, node, weight) 3-tuples in each edgelist
    - potentially use https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cache/
reasoning / comments : 
    - Currently, every time we make a PR, we have to manually test to make sure the PR didn't break the pipeline. A simple check like this would dramatically speed up workflow in the future
    - This is up for debate, depending on whether QSIPrep already does this and whether it would be useful
    - I also want to get familiar with Travis, and this is a good way to do so

07/01
DELIVERABLE : AWS batch run on 1 subject
details : 
    - Run docker image from OHBM (or new one) locally first
    - Set up ndmg-data s3 bucket with proper permissions, put that image on to AWS-batch
reasoning / comments : 
    - once this is set up seamlessly, running on any dataset should be trivial

07/08
DELIVERABLE : 5 datasets, run on AWS batch
details : 
    - HNU1, BNU3, SWU4, KKI, NKI
    - native space and mni
reasoning / comments : 
    - somewhat self-explanatory

07/15
DELIVERABLE : jupyter notebook EDA of 5 datasets
details : 
    - obvious thing: check norm of native graphs to make sure they're the same as derek's stampede outputs
    - use `graphutils` and `graspy` for this
    - update `graphutils` as necessary
reasoning / comments : 
    - jovo? don't know what would be best here  # TODO
    
07/22
DELIVERABLE : website updated with all datasets
details : 
    - Website will have needed to be updated for a long time at this point
    - Ideally : "download" button on website to let people directly download CSV edgelists
reasoning / comments : 
    - this has been needed to be added for a long time
    - deliverables after this point will intentionally get a bit vague, since we're getting pretty far into the future

07/29
DELIVERABLE : update `graphutils` with useful functions, or PR to graspy
details : 
    - likely will have ideas for useful functionality to add after 07/15
reasoning / comments : 
    - Mainly adding this because I'll have spent 07/01 and 07/08 and 07/22 not coding much, and I'll likely have ideas for stuff I want to implement + want to code more
    
08/05
DELIVERABLE : jupyter notebook analysis of all datasets, or finally do work on psychopathy data stuff?
details : 
reasoning / comments : 
    - need to talk to jovo about what would be good here

08/12
DELIVERABLE : schedule for ndmg day of hackashop
DELIVERABLE : presentation for ndmg day of hackashop
details : 
reasoning / comments : 
    - need to plan this out with Derek
    - talk about this with him in Rome

08/19 : NeuroData Hackashop
DELIVERABLE : mgc/rerf/graspy/ardent notebooks
details : 
reasoning / comments : 
    - use this week to learn a fuckload about our other tools
    - have a really solid plan for the hackashop with Derek by the week prior
    - hackashop should be fun (e.g., I want to learn how to use mgc + rerf + graspy better)

08/26
DELIVERABLE : more analysis notebooks? using mgc/rerf/graspy
details : 
reasoning / comments : 
    - Hard to plan out by this point, because the space of possibilities for where we'll be at is so large
    - In general, I am a fan of being at a point where I'm regularly doing analysis / data science / statistics work, so the more analysis / exploration after ndmg/qsiprep/whatever is stable the better
    - should be using graspy / mgc / rerf a lot at this point on dmri outputs to get a feel for them, especially since I'll have learned some stuff about our other tools from the hackashop


Vague brainstorming
--------
-  Be writing code more often than I spent the first portion of my time here writing code
- derek / me tests
- goal : get us to the point where the focus is on doing data science / data analysis, 
         not on fixing random bugs
- is it possible to get Drishti involved somehow?
- Ben gonna try to run ndmg
- general flow : make running stuff maintainable --> make running stuff easy and do a lot of it ---> do a bunch of analysis


GENERAL THINGS : to be specified into DELIVERABLEs
-------------
- OHBM gonna be a thing, figure out what I want to get out of it
- test on inputs / outputs
    - pytest fixture to create data directory
    - paramaterized fixtures to test different inputs
- derek wants test to make sure hemispheres are correct
    - create a hole in base image
    - right hemisphere or left hemisphere - image_R, image_L
    - run through ndmg
    - goal : test whether or not we get tractography with correct orientation
    - Streamlines should have hole on the same end
    - figure out how to make a hole in an image and save it on each side of the brain
- test of ndmg_dwi_worker
- AWS grant
- AWS batch : 5 datasets
- QA : ^5 datasets
- AWS batch : 20 datasets
- website updated
- my code for working with ndmg outputs
